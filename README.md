# NosLib / Noscka Library
NosLib or Noscka Library is a library (like boost) made to expand on existing std C++ features, as well as add generic functions and classes. I made this library to just contain boilerplate code I use commonly. So just make developing projects easier in the future (it contains stuff like string manipulation, file handling, error handling, networking features and so on)

## Supported Platforms
- Windows: Full support on windows, All functions and classes are available
- Linux: Works although some unimportant features are missing which I haven't got around to porting to Linux
- MacOS: Haven't tried, might work due to similiarties to linux but am doubtful
