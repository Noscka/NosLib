# NosLib / Noscka Library
NosLib or Noscka Library is a library (like boost) made to expand on existing std C++ features, as well as add generic functions and classes. I made this library to just contain boilerplate code I use commonly. So just make developing projects easier in the future (it contains stuff like string manipulation, file handling, error handling, networking features and so on)
