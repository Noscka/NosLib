# NosLib / Noscka Library
NosLib or Noscka Library is a library (like boost) made to expand on existing std C++ features, add new functions and classes for easier use and more. I have made this for personal use and so it won't be designed for "mass usage" but anyone is more then welcome to use, upgrade or add to the library. There is a [RULES.md](RULES.md) file for rules on naming, comments and anything else so I remember on how I should do certain things.
