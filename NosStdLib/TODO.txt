2. Add 2 Dimentional Vector and 3 Dimentional Vector from (https://github.com/Noscka/CSDLL-CSGO-internal/blob/GUI/CSDLL%20GUI%20VERSION/MultiVector.h), later and not now as I don't have a project to test it on

7. Add MoveLeft and MoveRight from (https://github.com/Noscka/Console-Loading-Screen/blob/master/Console%20Loading%20Screen/ConsoleLoadingScreen/LoadingScreen.hpp)
