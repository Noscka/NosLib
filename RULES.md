# Library Rules
a simple rule book so I remember how I should name functions, variables and etc.
1.	Namespaces, classes and functions must start with capitale letter
2.	namespaces (if it will help), classes, functions and variables must need comments or summaries to help understand what they do
3.	Summaries require "- " at the start of every \<Param\> Section
4.	Function Parameters must start with lowercase letter
5.	Do not use #param region inside functions as it lowers readablity
