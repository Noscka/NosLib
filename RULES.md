# Library Rules
a simple rule book so I remember how I should name functions, variables and etc.
1.	Namespaces, classes and functions must start with capital letter
2.	namespaces (if it will help), classes, functions and variables must need comments or summaries to help understand what they do
4.	Summaries require "- " at the start of every \<Param\> Section
5.	If function has default. then include (Parameter = DefaultValue) before the "- "
6.	Function Parameters must start with lowercase letter
7.	Do not use #param region inside functions as it lowers readablity
8.	Class and Enum Members/attributes must start with capital letter
